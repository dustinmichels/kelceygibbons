I am a PhD Candidate at MIT studying American histories of technology. My work centers on the vibrant, often overlooked lineages of African American education and professionalization.

By bridging the gap between archival research and multimedia storytelling, I seek to reveal how technological systems have been both sites of exclusion and tools for liberation.

I am a professional daydreamer, a multimedia storyteller, and I love my research so, so much. I believe that understanding our technical past is a prerequisite for building equitable futures.
