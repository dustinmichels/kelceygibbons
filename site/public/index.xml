      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a PhD Candidate at MIT studying American histories of technology. My work centers on the vibrant, often overlooked lineages of African American education and professionalization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By bridging the gap between archival research and multimedia storytelling, I seek to reveal how technological systems have been both sites of exclusion and tools for liberation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am a professional daydreamer, a multimedia storyteller, and I love my research so, so much. I believe that understanding our technical past is a prerequisite for building equitable futures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The day I noticed Colonial Phil, was new student orientation day. Us Student Ambassadors were all dressed-up in mustard yellow shirts, black slacks, blazers adorned with shiny gold name-tag. It was a serous day. A day when hundreds of people decided to start something new.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For many, if not most, this was a late start or a second beginning at college. Some were nervous and politely waited for an Ambassadors to hand them informational brushers, pencils, calendar-notebook. Others were very much themselves. I remember a leather jacketed older man laughing as he adjusted his Kango cap reminiscing. I did not know him, but he was familiar as if I had met him sometime before. His Family Dollar, Tommy Hilfiger cologne smelled like my brother, a little old man at church, or maybe an uncle Moe or Berry who had the swagger to find home in new settings. There were also kids— young people who decided to avoid college debt by putting in two years here and then two years elsewhere. Some kids were accompanied by parents who were apprehensively examining the non-Drexel, non-Lasale environment that their Kristen or Todd had chosen. Some parents brought their kids because lack of child care was not going to stop them from attending. Some kids, forever kids, were there with forever parents who wanted to memorialize the serous intervention becoming a Community College student was for the family. It was in this community that Student Ambassador also meant semi-professional, a picture perfect symbol of what could be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hot-mic-season-7-ep-10&#34;&gt;Hot Mic Season 7 EP. 10&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcript: “Zuckerverse” Episode 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prologue Kelcey Gibbons (host): Today, on the show, I have the pleasure of talking with Mark Zuckerberg 2.0 about his plan for Facebook Life. According to articles in the New York Times, The Washington Post, and some teaser trailers we have all seen on Facebook, Facebook Life will work with Google, Clearview, and Amazon to both make and connect smart cities in the US. Led by Zuckerberg, the goal is to revolutionize communication, strengthen community, and update the urban space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let me crawl out of my skin and put on something more comfortable,&amp;rdquo; she said; closing the bathroom door, muffling the sound of running water. Hot steam slipped out from under the door – wanting to escape. He did not know who would be there when the door reopened, but he hoped she would still be there, unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I should say something,&amp;rdquo; he thought, panic growing in his heart…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He loved her just as she was, and the thought of seeing her differently scared him. She was perfect just as she was, just as he had always saw her, and he did not want that to change. But she was a shapeshifter. Who she was, was whoever she wanted to be. She told him to trust her. She had said, &amp;ldquo;Who I am is who I am on the inside, not on the out. To love me is to love all my faces, textures, and shapes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
